Title: Spring Boot Microservices: Currency Conversion System with Netflix Eureka and Distributed Tracing using Zipkin

Description:

Welcome to the Currency Conversion System, a resilient and scalable microservices architecture built using Spring Boot and seamlessly hosted on the Netflix Eureka naming server. This project consists of two main microservices: the currency-exchange-service and currency-conversion-service. These microservices communicate with each other via a Feign-based REST client, providing a robust and fault-tolerant solution for currency-related operations. I have seamlessly integrated distributed tracing using Zipkin, allowing you to trace and monitor requests across your microservices. Additionally, Zipkin has been effortlessly launched as a Docker image on your local system to facilitate efficient tracking and analysis.

Key Features:

Microservices Architecture: The project is designed around two microservices, each serving a specific purpose—currency exchange rates retrieval and currency conversion.

Feign REST Client: The microservices seamlessly communicate with each other through a Feign-based REST client, ensuring simplicity and ease of integration.

Service Discovery with Netflix Eureka: Hosted on the Netflix Eureka naming server, the microservices dynamically discover and register with each other, enabling effortless communication and scalability.

API Gateway: All microservices traffic is efficiently managed and routed through a centralized entry point provided by the Spring Cloud Gateway.

Logging Filter: The Spring Cloud Gateway incorporates a logging filter, offering comprehensive insights into the request/response lifecycle for enhanced debugging and monitoring.

Fault Tolerance with Resilience4j: Resilience4j is utilized to build fault-tolerant microservices, ensuring robustness even in the face of transient failures.

Actuator Endpoints: Monitoring and managing the microservices are simplified with Spring Boot Actuator, providing various endpoints for health checks, metrics, and operational functionalities.

Dependencies Used:

spring-boot-starter-actuator
spring-cloud-starter-gateway
spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client
spring-boot-devtools
spring-boot-starter-test
[Other required dependencies]
How to Use:

Currency Exchange Service: Obtain real-time currency exchange rates by interacting with the currency-exchange-service.

Currency Conversion Service: Utilize the currency-conversion-service to convert a specified quantity of one currency to another.

API Gateway: Access the entire system efficiently through the API Gateway, managing and routing traffic seamlessly.

Distributed Tracing: Leverage Zipkin to trace requests across microservices, gaining insights into the entire request flow for efficient monitoring and optimization.
